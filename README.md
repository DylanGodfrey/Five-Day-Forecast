# Five-Day-Forecast

## Description

This website will allow users to easily find the five-day weather forecast for any city they search for. This project utilizes the OpenWeatherAPI for obtaining the weather data, localStorage for storing that data, jQuery for displaying the data and Bootstrap for styling the application.

## Installation

To install, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/DylanGodfrey/Five-Day-Forecast
```

## Usage

Searching for a city using the text field and clicking the 'Search' button will display both the current weather and five day forecast of that city. It will then save that query to the sidebar, of which you can click to re-query the API again for that city.
